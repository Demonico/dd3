- System *D*esign
- *D*ata Structures and Algorithms
- In *3* Weeks

This repository contains my practice problems for algorithms and system design, organized by the week they were solved.
Use the indices below to find problems by topic or by week.

## How to Use This Repository

- Week directories will hold "lc/" and "sd/" directories
    - lc for leetcode.com problems
    - sd for system design
- Algorithm solutions will be in Python files
- System Designs will be in markdown with screenshots of designs from whiteboarding
- The indexes below will organize solutions by week and by topic
