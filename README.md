# DD3
- System *D*esign
- *D*ata Structures and Algorithms
- In *3* Weeks

This repository contains my practice problems for algorithms and system design, organized by the week they were solved. Use the indices below to find problems by topic or by week.

## How to Use This Repository
- Week directories will hold "algo/" and "sd/" directories
- Algorithm solutions will be in Python files
- System Designs will be in markdown with screenshots of designs from whiteboarding
- The indexes below will organize solutions by week and by topic


## Problem Index by Topic

### Algorithms
#### Arrays
- [Two Sum](week1/algo/two_sum.py)
- [Valid Parentheses](week1/algo/valid_parentheses.py)

#### System Design
