## **Unified 3-Week Plan: Algorithms/Data Structures + System Design**

### **Week 1: Foundations**
#### **Algorithms/Data Structures**
- Focus on core concepts:
  - Arrays, strings, hash maps, stacks, queues, recursion, and sorting algorithms.
- **Goal**: Solve easy and medium problems, solidify Big-O analysis.
- **Resources**:
  - Algo.monster: Core patterns (sliding window, two pointers, etc.).
  - Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions.

#### **System Design**
- Learn the basics:
  - Scalability, load balancers, caching, database types (SQL vs. NoSQL), and APIs.
- **Resources**:
  - *Grokking the System Design Interview*: Focus on the first 4–5 chapters.
  - Outco videos for visual explanations.

---

### **Week 2: Intermediate Skills and Patterns**
#### **Algorithms/Data Structures**
- Focus on advanced topics:
  - Dynamic programming, graphs (DFS, BFS), and trees.
- **Goal**: Solve medium-to-hard problems.
- **Resources**:
  - Algo.monster: Advanced topics and patterns.
  - *Cracking the Coding Interview*: Target specific problem sets.
  - Cormen's *Introduction to Algorithms*: As needed for deeper understanding.

#### **System Design**
- Learn design patterns:
  - Sharding, replication, CAP theorem, consistent hashing.
- Practice designing smaller systems:
  - E.g., URL shortener, chat applications.
- **Resources**:
  - Continue *Grokking the System Design Interview*.
  - *System Design Interview* by Alex Xu.

### **Week 3: Mastery and Mock Practice**
#### **Algorithms/Data Structures**
- **Goal**: Master weak areas and simulate interview problems daily (timed).
- **Resources**:
  - Combine Algo.monster and Grokking for targeted reviews.
  - *Cracking the Coding Interview*: Select mock interview problems.

#### **System Design**
- Practice end-to-end designs:
  - Distributed systems, high-traffic applications.
- Simulate system design interviews with a whiteboard or virtual tools.
- **Resources**:
  - Final chapters of *Grokking the System Design Interview*.
  - Alex Xu’s *System Design Interview* (as a reference guide).

### **Daily Schedule**
- **Morning (2–3 hours)**:
  - Algorithms/Data Structures: Learn a concept or pattern, solve 3–5 problems.
- **Afternoon (2–3 hours)**:
  - System Design: Study a concept, design a system, or watch relevant videos.
- **Evening (1–2 hours)**:
  - Reflection: Review notes, identify weak areas, and revise.
