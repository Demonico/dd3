## Common Stuff

In-line math is surrounded by single "\$" symbols i.e. \$f(n)\$ becomes $f(n)$. 
There are other ways to do it in LaTex  

Display equations are surrounded by double "\$" symbols i.e.

\$\$
\begin{align}
a  - b & = c \\
d  & = e - f
\end{align}
\$\$
becomes
$$
\begin{align}
a & = b + c \\
d + f & = e
\end{align}
$$
